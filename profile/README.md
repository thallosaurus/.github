# I AM OPEN FOR WORK

My name is Philipp and I create code. I am passionate about building strange tools, cyberdelic systems and operating systems. Computers are an extension of our mind and as such should be treated like one.

## the fock you doin m8?
- I have built my own network audio-streamer, my own physical blender camera with an old iPhone and numerous websites
- I love playing with technology to reach a goal I have put my mind to
- On the side I create music under the alias "rillonautikum" which you can find on Soundcloud and Spotify
- I am interested in the intersection of code, consciousness and creativity

## my toolbox
- Languages: Rust, TypeScript, Go
- Tools: Docker, Git (ya dont say), Web Technologies, Blender, VueJS and Postgres

## I donâ€™t code just for utility. I code because it allows me to shape the world the way I feel it should be. Between logic and emotion lies creation.
